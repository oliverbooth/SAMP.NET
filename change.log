			(+1 overload: Player.PlaySound (int, Vector3))
		> Player.PlayCrimeReport (Player, int)

	+ Updated the mscorlib.dll library
		(This should fix some big problems. Mainly the problem of the server "not working" or crashing if you use the 'exit' command)

	+ Included the mono-2.0.dll library in the server directory

	* Changed static Vehicle.GetComponentType to return type SAMP.API.ComponentSlot
		(SAMP.API.ComponentSlot is simply an enum containing the slots and their integer values)

	* Cleaned up source code a bit

	* Fixed an issue where Vector2 and Vector3 weren't part of the API namespace

	* Fixed an issue with the hook GetPlayerColor was returning an int instead of unsigned int
		(NOTE: Also changed the .NET API from int to uint)

	- Removed Player.OnText on the VB.NET example
		(I was testing something. Removed for pointlessness)

	- Deprecated the World.SendMessageToAll overload which took a 'uint' argument.
		(Use SAMP.API.Color instead)
