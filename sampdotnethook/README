Important Note:
The Visual Studio project for the C++ hook was omitted since the introduction of the Linux-ready release.
In its place, a Code::Blocks project has been created. (Code::Blocks is a cross-platform open-source IDE)
The options have been pre-set for cross-compiling on both Windows and Linux, but there is some housekeeping you'll need to do if you want to build on either:

== Building On Windows ==
- Steps -
1) Load the project Build Options
2) Edit the Linker Settings
3) Remove the lib\limono-2.0.so library from the linker
4) Rebuild the project

- Why? -
The .so library is a Linux "shared object", equivilent to a .dll on Windows. The linker has pre-set options to scan the lib/ directory for mono-2.0.dll, so we don't need to add that back in to the list.

== Building on Linux ==
- Steps
1) Load the project Build Options
2) Edit the Linker Settings
3) Under "Other linker options", omit the "def.def" flag from the list
4) Rebuild the project

- Why? -
The definition module is a Windows-specific file for the linker to export the AMX functions to the DLL. Linux does a good job at not obfuscating function names upon compiling because it doesn't require the __stdcall convention to export said functions, so we don't need a definition module for this purpose.
It also throws errors because it's not a recognised file so just go with it.
